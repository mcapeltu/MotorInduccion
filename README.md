Automatic Machine Learning (AML) methods are currently considered of great interest for use in the development of cyber-physical systems. However, in practice, they present serious application problems with respect to fitness computation, overfitting, lack of scalability, and the need for an enormous amount of time for the computation of neural network hyperparameters. In this work, we have experimentally investigated the impact of continuous updating and validation of the hyperparameters, on the performance of a cyber-physical model, with four estimators based on feedforward and narx ANNs, all with the gradient descent-based optimization technique. The main objective is to demonstrate that the optimized values of the hyperparameters can be validated by simulation with MATLAB/Simulink following a mixed approach based on interleaving the updates of their values with a classical training of the ANNs without affecting their efficiency and automaticity of the proposed method. For the two relevant variables of an Induction Motor (IM), two sets of estimators have been trained from the input current and voltage data. In contrast, the training data for the speed and output electromagnetic torque of the IM have been established with the help of a new Simulink model developed entirely. The results have demonstrated the effectiveness of ANN estimators obtained with the Deep Learning Toolbox (DLT) that we used to transform the trained ANNs into blocks that can be directly used in cyber-physical models designed with Simulink
